										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moon Rock Café is a fast-paced Overcooked inspired game where the player has to manage a lot of responsibilities in a space-restaurant. Your main goal is to juggle a lot of different tasks such as seating customers, taking their order &amp; making sure they don&#8217;t order something they&#8217;re allergic to, getting the orders to the kitchen and finally, when the food is ready, delivering that meal to the correct alien!</p>
<h3>My responsibilities in the project</h3>
<p>I wrote the code for the core game play loop in this game, another programmer was responsible for the audio manager and one programmer did the Upgrade system.</p>
<p>My contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Player &amp; camera movement.</li>
<li>Customer spawning, seating, order handling, kitchen logic, and food handling.</li>
<li>Customer AI.</li>
<li>Modular customer system that let us easily create different customer types in the editor using ScriptableObjects as building pieces.</li>
<li>Tutorial system with scrolling tutorial text that respects line-breaks.</li>
<li>ScriptableObject event system that can send events with generic data type(s).</li>
</ul>
