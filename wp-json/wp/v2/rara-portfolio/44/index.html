Your main goal is to juggle a lot of different tasks such as seating customers, taking their order &amp; making sure they don&#8217;t order something they&#8217;re allergic to, getting the orders to the kitchen and finally, when the food is ready, delivering that meal to the correct alien before the food goes bad!<\/p>\n<p>It might seem simple at first, but very soon you will find yourself overwhelmed by the vast amounts of aliens that find their way to this space-eatery!<\/p>\n<h3>My responsibilities in the project<\/h3>\n<p>I wrote the code for the core game play loop in this game and a few other systems such as the tutorial system, spawning system, and day-cycle system, and UI programming (food progress, ordering, tutorial, over-head popups). This project was made with fellow Future Games students during a 3-week project.<\/p>\n<p>My contributions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Player &amp; camera movement.<\/li>\n<li>Customer spawning, seating, order handling, kitchen logic, and food handling.<\/li>\n<li>Customer AI.<\/li>\n<li>UI Code<\/li>\n<li>Modular customer system that let us easily create different customer types in the editor using ScriptableObjects as building pieces.<\/li>\n<li>Tutorial system with scrolling tutorial text that respects line-breaks. System is event-based and highly flexible.<\/li>\n<li>ScriptableObject event system that can send events with generic data type(s).<\/li>\n<li>Upgradeable systems such as the possibility to cook more food at once, unlocking more tables in the restaurant, cooking faster, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Customer deaths if they get food that has been spoiled by being on the counter for too long, or if the food item contains an ingredient that the customer is allergic to.<\/li>\n<li>Overhead pop-up system when the a pays for their meal \/ gives reputation.<\/li>\n<li>Some simple shaders (blood shader &amp; food spilled on floor).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Link to github repo: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/alvolex\/GP2Team10\">https:\/\/github.com\/alvolex\/GP2Team10<\/a><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-623b40c12cdbe wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\t\t<div class=\"embedpress-gutenberg-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper aligncenter\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"ose-imgur ose-uid-b37fdab59e5e10a04247fc5d2efacbe1 ose-embedpress-responsive\" style=\"width:600px; max-width:100%; height: auto; display:inline-block;\"><blockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"BHtzm1r\"><a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/BHtzm1r\">View post on imgur.com<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"\/\/s.imgur.com\/min\/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"embedpress-gutenberg-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper aligncenter\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"ose-imgur ose-uid-c75d550de75d831d1763bb33dc42be65 ose-embedpress-responsive\" style=\"width:600px; max-width:100%; height: auto; display:inline-block;\"><blockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"9Ohk0wS\"><a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/9Ohk0wS\">View post on imgur.com<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"\/\/s.imgur.com\/min\/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Moon Rock Caf\u00e9 is a fast-paced Overcooked inspired game where the player has to manage a lot of responsibilities in a space-restaurant.
